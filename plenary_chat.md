What are the different facets of complexity:
emerging properties / mechanism / 

complexity depends on the description of the object

complexity <=> uncertainty <=> probability

*  Non-linearity of the dynamical sistem
*  Random model ok, but how to compare different observed networks.
*  Is it possible to find a universal comparison?
*  When is a network NOT complex?
*  Why is complexity relevant?

write to general community ecologists, that have a preconceived notion of complexity.

microbial community ecologists (usually they are cooccurance nets) <- an example! (and macro)
plant ecology, fungi, host-parasite

try to reach out to other communities: interaction networks.
Writing it for food webs and translating it to other fields?

Do we want to include numerical analysis?

different kind of interactions
